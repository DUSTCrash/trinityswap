# Welcome to trinityswap 

Don't think a crypto exchange can be open-source, well we'd like to change your mind. Low fees (0.3%), open-source code, and we're one of the first solana Dex's (Decentralized Exchanges). Trinityswap is built on project serum giving you access to huge crypto liquidity pools that are already funded. Visit: trinityswap.com to start trading on the solana blockchain now.
