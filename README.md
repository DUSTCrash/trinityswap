# Welcome to trinityswap: the most simple and easy-to-use solana DEX 

Don't think a crypto exchange can be open-source, well we'd like to change your mind. Low fees (0.3%), open-source code, and we're one of the first solana Dex's (Decentralized Exchanges). Trinityswap is built on project serum giving you access to huge crypto liquidity pools that are already funded.
